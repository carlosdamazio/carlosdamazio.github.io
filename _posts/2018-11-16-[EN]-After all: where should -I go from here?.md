I know, I know. I'm not keeping my blog updated as I'd like to be. And no, this
post is not about Angular. I promissed to talk about Angular on the services
contexts, but now this is not as important anymore to write about since we have
kind of kagilions of blogs who writes about Angular and front-end stuff for each
version that appears (which is a lot).

On the former, allow me to explain...

## Stuff happens

I got hired 7 months ago to work with Linux infrastructure projects.
Mainly on the beginning I was working solelly to implement infrastructure
projects for my company's clients. But then, after showing what I'm effective
on Python programming and Web Development as general, I started to work on
development projects using Python stack (Django, DRF, Flask) and aswell with
front-end tools such as JS, Angular.js, jQuery and the basics that I don't even
call it programming (HTML5/CSS3) with another experienced developer.

But since he left, no one was as qualified as him to handle these projects
except for me (nothing to brag about on this regard). Turns out I became a
Full-Stack Developer for the company to work with this particular client. So I
picked up the pace. With at least 3 projects I've been working at the same time,
with meetings, calls, coding and more coding, it turned out that the blog had a
halt for the time being. Since then I've completed 2 projects, I got a bit of
time for myself to write stuff in here.

For a while now, I've been wondering about my career choice of being solelly a
full-stack developer and Python developer. Turns out my 1 year of development
work were exclusivelly for:

- Python;
- JavaScript.

I know a bit of Java, but not enough to call myself a Java developer (even
though I dislike this language because of life experiences), I didn't have enough
tools for being a skilled, specialized and yet a diversed developer.
There was this project that I had to work with C language. It was a complete
nightmare since I couldn't understand some low-level concepts (memory allocation,
pointers, structs) and how things worked. I got really frustrated. But maybe
this frustration was a waking call for me, to know other ventures to follow and
to improve my craft.

## Where should I go now?

After this frustration of getting a beatdown on this project, I got lost and
even felt a bit unmotivated. But
then I started recently to connect things up and started to venture on fields 
once unknown and feared to me.

So let's start from the beginning of all, collecting a couple of facts:

- My first programming experience that I had was in 2010 from a friend who showed
me Linux and C programming. I literally asked him if I could do anything that I
could with the computer by just programming;
- Since then, all computers that I had, you could just assume that it had Linux
ALL over it. And started to venture with C programming, but at the time I was only
13, and when things got a little difficult to program because I didn't mature
enought to pick abstractions up, I called it a day;
- Then I joined college, and there I started to program again with nothing more
or nothing less than Java;
- I really disliked Java because of it's verbose syntax, JVM eating all my computer's
memory and tasteless for environment setting. Even though I learned a lot about
OOP, Web Development, etc, I didn't regret to switch to PHP, and I got really mad
of how tasteless this language is;
- But then I found Python, and I fell in love with it, the rest you know what's up.

Oh wait, I forgot one thing or two:

- I didn't even learn Algorithms until I was really interested in it, because
my teacher sucked on teaching and I was lazy;
- Even though I did a CS degree, I didn't fixate all my knowledge of computing
on my head, specially the part of Computer Architecture. I started to fixate it
on my own;
- I had a unexplained fear of C programming.

So then, after collecting all facts recently and finishing college, I knew
something has to be done.

## Realized what was my passion

We all in CS field should know that we'll never stop learning (or teaching). So
I took my time to pick things that I should learn and improve:

- Systems Programming: After the C project, I realized that some skill of 
Systems Programming really lacked. Even though I secretly liked it because of
what it is capable of doing with it.

So, adding up this skill, I have now 3 ventures to follow. But what about the
tools? I redefined my stack:

- Python: Systems Programming? Checked. Web Development? Checked. Passion? Checked;
- JavaScript and TypeScript: I'm a full-stack developer after all;
- C: Systems Programming? Checked. Web Development? Negative, but at least there
is sockets. Passion and a bit of nostalgia? Checked.

And there is a new contender for the position on my stack:

- Golang: Systems Programming? Checked. Web Development? Checked. And I fount 
it's simplicity cute.

Still I'm keeping my Linux knowledge sharp, databases aswell (SQL and noSQL) and
Shell Scripting. Eventually, I'll learn something else because it's what CS field
is, different concepts appears everytime and maybe I'll be living to watch
Quantum Computing being as common as our transistors are in our computers. But
one thing is important:

I'll keep my passion alive as long as I can, and even when it halts, I'll have
this same conversation again with myself until I cannot longer do it.
