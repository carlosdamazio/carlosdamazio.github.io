# First of all: Why?

Two words: context and purpose.

I get that blogging is in a hype since... I don't know. But I was reading *Pragmatic Thinking and Learning* by Andy Hunt and I kind of mistook the reason why we blog.

## Context
When I was just starting out with programming, web development, infrastructure analysis, I had been trying to prove a point to myself that I could make technical details look easier to grasp. But that went downhill because of ego and procrastination. Mainly, ego leads to procrastination, in my case. 
 
 Since I've been trying to prove a point, it led me to have obligations because I needed to keep up with the habit, but not because I liked it. So every time I come up with something to write, I felt the dread creeping around. So I stopped with the blog. I got out of my former company (4Linux) and joined a big one to work with a big and important client, one of the biggest Brazilian banks. Everything until that point I felt that I was in my peak, actually, I sucked at hard and it came like a train hitting another one head-on without braking. I was victim of another *Dunning-Kruger Effect*, but I felt a relief.

 Why? Because of that, I knew where I was going and where my path was going to be, I've been enforcing the **No Bullshit Policy** even by my own conceived biases ever since. I only have 2 years of career, I don't actually know shit and maybe some things that I happen to write in here might actually be full of shit by many of reasons. But at the present time, I felt something clicked in my billions of billions of neurons within my gray matter. Since the **No Bullshit Policy** was up, I started to break some of the biases that I had in learning. And I happen to find a book called *Pragmatic Thinking and Learning* by Andy Hunt. I've been reading it for a while, but I got many useful insights about learning and breaking biases that I've ever could imagine. So it leads to...

## Purpose
Yep. There's a reason why we blog. Some want to be the best writer with all cylinders firing up to grasp that story in their own heads to words for us to understand. Maybe some want to do it for the ego ~~yup~~, but maybe some of them want to visualize the actual knowledge they have and get some feedback of it to improvement. But the main purpose that we get to write things in it because we want to stream our buffer out of our brains, so we can understand and refine our thinking. 

By writing, we can find what we actually know and what biases we have are flawed and it's a big challenge for us to face these flaws. But I swallowed my ego up and found out that it's the only way the can acquire expertise. It's to experience, to experiment and to learn something, it's to defy what we know and what we think we know. And it doesn't have to be boring. It's not an obligation, it's a tool for me, a fun tool, actually. Well, I might get going now. 


That's it. This may clarify what I've been through and some struggles that I'd been facing. Now, onwards, to destiny.
