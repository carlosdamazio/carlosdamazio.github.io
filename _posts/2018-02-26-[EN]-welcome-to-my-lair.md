# It's been a while...

A long time ago I tried to make a blog with the same purpose as I'm doing now,
but I kinda got lost in the way and because...

**TIME CONSTRAINTS**!

Are you serious? Nobody game me a freaking break. So much happened, I got a fairly
new ~~5 month~~ internship going on, other projects going on, since I've been
interested in programming.
I didn't like it at all when I first started Computer Science, but I kind of
regret of not liking it earlier. You know what? Screw regret. The important
thing is that I'm starting it now, even though I'm at the end of my bachelor's.


I'm Carlos, a Computer Science student and a forever learner Software Developer.
Pleased to meet you.


In this little hideout, I'm going to write a lot of stuff that I find interesting.
Here's a little bit of it:

## Software Development
It's what I do and enjoy, for that I get frustrated sometimes, but start loving
it again when I discover the reasons for bugs and issues to surface and when I
learn something new and hard.

## Web Development
Same as the whole statement above, but regarding internet, WWW, INTERNET
EXPLORER ~~edgy~~ BROWSERS ~~those heathens~~ AND MEMES. Also CSS.

Also backend, it's a two way street, right? RIGHT?

## Theory
Maybe there'll be a little bit of it.

## Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (with a grain of salf of Data Science)
I don't know a single thing about these topics and I find them the most interesting
that I've ever heard about, even for a little. If I do learn something, lemme share it with you.

That's it folks, I'm going to do the best to keep this up. Check out for more
stuff later!
